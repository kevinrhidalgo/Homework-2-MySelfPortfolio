<p>
   Hello, my name is Kevin Hidalgo and I am a web developer in the making and a current full-time student 
   at the UCF coding bootcamp. I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York until 2019 in which I moved to Orlando, Florida. 
   Growing up there was, I always had two career paths I wanted to pursue, a coder or a cardiologist. Prior to deciding between the two, 
   upon entering college I chose to purse a career in medicine. I got as far as my junior year, in which I made the difficult decision to 
   change career paths due to some unfortunate events. Leaving me in a stagnant state of mind, not knowing how to transition to another 
   career path. 
</p>
<p>
   A couple of years ago a friend gave me the idea of joining a coding bootcamp, knowing my interest and desire to find an entrance into the world of 
   web developing. After a few years of researching and finding the correct program and timing, I was able to find and join the UCF coding bootcamp where
   we are learinig how to build web applications such as this one. The purpose of this page is to showcase some of my developing skills as a developer as 
   I progress in this program. This page will be linked to various websites that I will be able to attach once completed, and I am excited to show off my
   potential and skills I will develope as I progress to complete the coding bootcamp.
